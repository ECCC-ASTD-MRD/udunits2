Dear UDUNITS user,

The UDUNITS-2 package is now available from the UDUNITS homepage at
<http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/>.

The UDUNITS-2 package differs from the previous UDUNITS package in the
following ways:

    Support for non-ASCII characters. The original UDUNITS package only
    supports the ASCII character set. The UDUNITS-2 package supports
    the following character sets: ASCII, ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1), and the
    UTF-8 encoding of ISO 10646 (Unicode). This means that unit string
    specifications like "µ°F·Ω⁻¹" are now supported (your viewer
    must support UTF-8 to display this string correctly).

    Support for logarithmic units. The unit string specification
    "0.1 lg(re 1 mW)" specifies a deciBel unit with a one milliwatt
    reference level.  Meteorologists should note that the unit "dBZ"
    (i.e., "0.1 lg(re um^3)") is now supported.

    Persistent value converters. It is now possible to obtain a converter
    data-object, which can be used to convert numeric values in one
    unit to numeric values in another, compatible unit. The values can
    be float, double, or one-dimensional arrays of floats or doubles.

    Improved API. Due to the above changes, it was not possible to keep
    the application programming interface of the original UDUNITS package.
    The new interface, however, is easily understood and easy to use.

    XML unit database. The unit database is encoded using human-readable
    XML rather than a custom format. The XML parser included in the
    package supports an <import> element to allow easy and convenient
    customization.

One thing that has not changed is that all unit string specifications
understood by the original UDUNITS package are also understood by the
new UDUNITS-2 package.

Please visit the webpage or email <support-udunits@unidata.ucar.edu> if
you have questions or comments.

Steve Emmerson
UDUNITS-2 Developer
