@cindex Introduction

The UDUNITS-2 package provides support for units of physical quantities.
Its three main components are: 1) @ref{Top, , a C library, udunits2lib}
for units of physical quantities;
2) @ref{Top, , a utility, udunits2prog};
for obtaining the definition of a unit and for
converting numeric values between compatible units;
and 3) an extensive database of units.

@cindex obtaining this package

Get this package from its home-page at
@uref{http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/}
and unpack it someplace convenient, e.g.,

@example
cd /tmp
gunzip -c udunits-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz | tar -xf -
@end example

@section Short Installation Instructions
The following assumes that you are familiar with autoconf-based
package-installation.
If you're not, then follow the long instructions in the
next section.

@example
./configure [--prefix=@var{root}] [--disable-shared] [CC=@var{path}]
make
make check    # optional; requires CUNIT installation
make install
make install-info install-html install-pdf
make clean
@end example

If you encounter problems, then follow the instructions in the
next section.

@node Long, What, Short, Install
@section Long Installation Instructions

@enumerate
@item
Go to the top-level source-directory of this package, e.g.,
@example
cd udunits-@value{VERSION}
@end example

@item
Because some @code{make} utilities cannot build this package correctly,
locate the operating system that is closest to yours in the following table
and determine the @var{make} utility that you will use from the
potential candidates.
@quotation
@include make.texi
@end quotation

@item
If necessary, clean-up from a previous installation attempt by making
the @code{distclean} target using the @var{make} utility from step 2:
@example
@var{make} distclean
@end example

@item
Because some compilers cannot build this package correctly,
locate the operating system closest to yours in the following table
and determine the compiler
that you will use and any required option for the @code{configure} script.
@quotation
@include success.texi
@end quotation

The option @code{--disable-shared} causes the build process to create
a static library only: a sharable library is not created.
This option is necessary if the @code{libtool} utility that's included
in this package can't build a sharable library using the given compiler.

The following table shows the build environments that do not work ---
so don't use them:
@quotation
@include failure.texi
@end quotation

@item
Execute the @code{configure} script.
Specify the installation prefix, the compiler from the
previous step, and any required option.
For example, if you are on an HP-UX system and want to use
the @code{/bin/c89} compiler and install under @code{/opt},
then the following command is appropriate:
@example
./configure --prefix=/opt --disable-shared CC=/bin/c89
@end example

If the installation prefix is not specified, then the default
is to install under @code{/usr/local}.

If the compiler isn't specified, then the default is to use
@code{gcc}.

@item
Build this package by making the default target using the @var{make} utility
from step 2:
@example
@var{make}
@end example

@item
If you wish to verify that this package works correctly,
then make the @code{check} target using the
@var{make} utility from step 2:
@example
@var{make} check
@end example
This step is only effective if the @code{configure} script found an
installed @code{CUNIT} unit-testing package.  If that package wasn't
found, then the above command will quickly exit without testing this
package.

@item
Install the @ref{Top, , library, udunits2lib}, 
@ref{Top, , utility, udunits2prog}, header-files, and units-database by making 
the @code{install} target using the @var{make} utility from
step 2:
@example
@var{make} install
@end example

@item
If desired, install the documentation by making 
one or more of the following targets 
using the @var{make} utility from step 2:
@example
@var{make} install-info install-html install-pdf
@end example

@item
Clean up by making the @code{clean} target using the @var{make} utility
from step 2:
@example
@var{make} clean
@end example
@end enumerate
