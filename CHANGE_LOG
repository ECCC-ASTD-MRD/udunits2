2.1.1
	Corrected and improved the in-house make(1) targets "ftp" and
	"download-update".

	Added publication of the XML database on the UDUNITS website to
	the target "web-update".

2.1.0	2009-03-11
	Added UDUNITS-1 API.  This thin interface uses the UDUNITS-2
	library.  Users will have to recompile their UDUNITS-1-based 
	code using the new "udunits.h" header-file and rebuild their
	programs using the new UDUNITS-2 library.  Because the UDUNITS-1
	API uses the "utUnit" data-structure and the UDUNITS-2 API uses
	pointers to "ut_unit" data-structures, a small memory-leak is 
	possible in code that creates many units.  This leak can be 
	avoided by calling the new method utFree(utUnit*) when the unit
	is no longer needed.

	Added some "const" qualifiers to the API.

	Modified ut_format() for timestamp units.  It now prints the
	long form (with hyphens and colons) if the year of the origin is
	less than 1000 or greater than 9999.  This was done to make
	ut_format() compatible with ut_parse().

2.0.4	2009-02-21
	Added copyright notices and LICENSE file.

2.0.3	2009-02-18
        Added the function ut_root(const ut_unit* unit, int root) to
        return a root of a unit (e.g., "m2/s2" -> "m/s").

2.0.2	2008-12-02
	Changed order of calls to ut_set_status() and
	ut_handle_error_message() so that the status value is always set
	before the error-message handler is called.  This allows error
	handlers to determine the cause of the message.

2.0.1	2008-11-13
	Added parsing of timestamps that have dashes and colons but also
	use "T" (e.g., "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z").

	Corrected the regular expressions for matching the character-set
	specifier in the udunits2(1) program.

2.0.0	2007-07-18
	Initial release.
