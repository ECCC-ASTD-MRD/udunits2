2.0.2	2008-12-02
	Changed order of calls to ut_set_status() and
	ut_handle_error_message() so that the status value is always set
	before the error-message handler is called.  This allows error
	handlers to determine the cause of the message.

2.0.1	2008-11-13
	Added parsing of timestamps that have dashes and colons but also
	use "T" (e.g., "seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z").

	Corrected the regular expressions for matching the character-set
	specifier in the udunits2(1) program.

2.0.0	2007-07-18
	Initial release.
